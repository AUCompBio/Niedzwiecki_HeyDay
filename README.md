**Overview**

Hey Day is a tradition that started in the years of World War II on Auburn's campus. Students on campus get to make name tags so that anyone can walk by and say "Hey!" to them, even if it is someone you have never met. The beauty of Hey Day is its unifying power as it allows everyone at Auburn to be connected. It creates an incredibly friendly atmosphere on campus and makes everyone feel welcome!
